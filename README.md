'Cause it’s Crunch Time
Combine rolled oats with nuts and seeds, coat those dry ingredients in a mix of fat (most often oil) and liquid sweetner (such as honey or maple syrup) and bake until lighly toasted and bound together . . . and Boom! you’ve got granola.
Basic Granola Ratio (TLDR: 6 dry : 1 wet)
Anna Stockwell likes to break it down like this:
Dry Mix is 6 : 1 of the total

Make half of your dry mix rolled oats (do not use instant oats!).
Split the second half into one part nut, one part seed, and one part something else (like coconut)
Wet Mix is 1 : 6 of the total

The wet mix can be split evenly (1 part oil to 1 part sweet liquid), or adjusted to your taste. (A 1 : 1 ratio here will be less sweet than most commercially produced granolas).
Optional: Adding an egg white to the wet mix will help the granola clump up and make it shiny.

Granola Tips
Assembling
It’s easy to swap ingredients in granola recipes - just maintain the ratio of wet to dry ingredients.
Combine dry ingredients before adding liquid fats and sweetners to avoid clumping of spices. (Tip from Megan Gordon of Marge Granola)
If you want your granola to be extra-clumpy, and I know you do, press it down in the pan with a spatula, and don’t break it up until it’s cooled down for about 10 minutes post-bake. (Another tip from Megan)
Raw nuts need a longer cook time, and can go in the oven along with the oats, binders, and spices. Roasted nuts can burn and become bitter if baked too long, so . . .
Add roasted nutes and dried fruit immediately after baking.
Delicate ingredients like coconut flakes that just need a light toast, can go in for the last 15 minutes of bake time.
